    "\n",
    "Given a five-year CRC survival rate, compute the mean of the exponential distribution with that survival rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "When time to death has an exponential distribution, there is a mathematical relationship between the survival rate and the mean of the distribution:\n",
    "```\n",
    "μ = -n / ln(P(t > n))\n",
    "```\n",
    "Where `μ` is the mean of the exponential distribution, `n` is the time at which survival is assessed (e.g., 5 for a 5-year survival rate), and `P(t > n)` is the survival rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will take advantage of this relationship to calculate model parameters `mean_duration_clin*_dead` directly, rather than calibrating them to survival rates as in the past. This will enable us to quickly calculate survival rates separately for various demographic groups, and parameterize the model to account for cohort demographics in its simulation of CRC survival."

    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the final approach described in `survival_rate_adjustment.ipynb`. In that notebook, we explored various ways to do this. Here, we implement the final approach of calculating the time-to-CRC-death distribution means directly from relative survival rates. That avoids the complexity of using overall survival rates and death tables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: population-level\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we calculate time-to-CRC-death distribution means by demographic group, we'll use the same approach to calculate them for the overall population.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the exploration in Step 6 of `survival_rate_adjustment.ipynb`, we know that this approach will lead to smaller distribution means, and therefore more CRC death, than the calibration approach. This is probably due to the dynamic explored in Step 5 of that notebook, which shows that our calibration approach underestimates CRC death.\n",
    "\n",
    "So first, we'll compare the values calculated here to the calibrated values in an experiment. By isolating this change, we will learn how much difference this change makes on CRC death rates under various screening scenarios. "
